The provided code already implements linear regression using the scikit-learn library in Python. Linear regression is a suitable algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent features. The algorithm aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points.

In the code:

1. The necessary libraries are imported.
2. Training and test datasets are read from CSV files.
3. The 'x' feature and target variable 'y' are extracted for both training and test sets.
4. A Linear Regression model is created using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class.
5. The model is trained using the training data.
6. Predictions are made for both the training and test sets.
7. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) scores are calculated for both sets.
8. The results are printed, and a plot is generated to visualize the regression line and actual data points.

If you want to explore other regression algorithms, you can consider algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, etc. Each algorithm has its strengths and may perform differently depending on the nature of the data. You can experiment with different algorithms to see which one performs best for your specific dataset.

To use a different algorithm, you would need to replace the `LinearRegression` model with the desired model and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly. For example, for a Decision Tree, you can use `DecisionTreeRegressor` from scikit-learn. The process of training, predicting, and evaluating remains similar. Here's an example using Decision Tree Regression:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Create a Decision Tree Regression model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()

# Fit the model using the training data
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Predict 'y' for the training data
y_train_pred = model.predict(x_train)

# Predict 'y' for the test data
y_test_pred = model.predict(x_test)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error for the training set
mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred)

# Calculate R^2 Score for the training set
r2_train = r2_score(y_train, y_train_pred)

# Calculate Mean Squared Error for the test set
mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred)

# Calculate R^2 Score for the test set
r2_test = r2_score(y_test, y_test_pred)

# Print results and plot as before...
```

Remember to explore and choose the algorithm that best fits your specific problem and dataset characteristics.
